- Testing a program and finding a point where the program fails. Display proper message when input is wrong and terminating the execution. 
- Makefile Tutorial and some of its syntaxes.
- Changing a.out file name to something else. A source code can have multiple executable binary files and they are all the same.
- Breaking a program into seperate files(called modules) each containing a function of the original combined program.
- How to compile these so called 'modules'. Example:- `gcc main.c bin.c` will combine both these files and then it will execute the entire program.

- The problem with global declaration of variables.
-  ```# include <stdio.h>``` and ```# include "pascals_triangle.h"```. What's the difference? Well ```<>``` are used for system header files. For example:- ```stdio.h```. By using ```<>``` you are telling the compiler to go look for a header file in the current directory you are working in. ```""``` are used for user-defined header files.
- Introduction to storage classes. Difference between stack and heap.

- Try writing all sorting programs like Bubble Sort, Quick Sort etc.
- Learn more about Memory Management and Storage Classes.
- A Brief Introduction on how to Debug a program in Ubuntu(Linux) using `gdb`. 
- `gdb` is a very powerful, very vast but not so user friendly tool. 
- command `gdb <binaryfile>` will debug the binary file. 
- There are two modes of execution:- </br>1)Debug mode where additional information required for debugging is added by including `-g` in the command.</br> 2) Release mode is just normal execution and the binary file doesn't contain any additional information about debugging. `gcc -g main.c` 
- type `ls -lrth` after each mode of execution and see the difference in sizes of two binary files created. 
- Certain commands in gdb:- `run` to run the program, `break` or `b` are used to add a breakpoint, `quit` to exit gdb, `layout` to view program in different layout. For example: `layout src` will display the source code, `layout asm` will display assembly code, `layout regs` to display different registers used. 
- Shortcuts in gdb and their meaning: 'n' for next-> Goes to the next instruction in the program, 'r' for restart-> Runs the program the beginning, 'p' for printing value that a variable has stored-> 'p sum' will print the value of sum.  
- `layout regs` will not display registers used if you are working on a Linux distribution like ubuntu in Windows environment. Only in a perfect linux environment, it works.
- See types of registers used in loops like 'for' and also recursion. Also see assembly code.
