- A review of my team project on "E-nose (Electronic nose)", its challenges and how to overcome. Suggestions:- Try using ESP-8266 which has inbuilt wifi module for data tranmission. For integrating two or more sensors, you will need to use a multiplexing device. Gaussian data would be better for our data collection. 
- A discussion on configurations of robots. For example, a robot of cylindrical work volume is very useful parking lots to automate the process of parking in a cylindrical building.
- Bee-keeping tutorial.
- An overview on concepts like classes and objects. Object being an instance of a class. Think of 'class' being a cookie cutter which defines shape and size of a cookie, when you make a cookie, it is an object which we can eat which has the properties of the class. But, we can't eat the class(cookie cutter) itself. There class doesn't have physical existence but an object doesn't.
- Learn the following concepts:
  - MACRO v/s Inline
  - Struct and C++ class
  - Abstract class
  - Copy constructor
  - Move semantics
  - Assigning an object to another</br>

- Why learning simulation softwares are important? It can help you analyse and design circuits before you actually try to build one in real life. This saves a lot of expenses.
- Try to build a constant current circuit in the simulation software.
- Optimize the stack program in the following way:
  - Imagine you don't know the no. of elements in the stack, how would you traverse and find out the middle element?
  - Without knowing the no. of elements, how would you insert and delete elements in the stack?</br>
# 16/7/23
- Find the middle element of the linked list and print it.
- Insert a node at a particular position.
- Delete a node at a particular position.
- Sorting the linked list.
- Print stack properly.
- Merge two linked lists.
- Forking repos in Github.
- `gd` stands for `go to definition` goes to a function definition, to come back to caller function, press `Ctrl+o`.
- Check out `libsox` library in C which is related to audio processing. Find resources, find the source code for it. Build the source code for it in linux environment.
# 2/7/23
- Debugging the stack program(linked lists).
- It's a bad practice to use global variables. To eliminate this problem, we can declare it in the `main` function and the pass the value(it can be a pointer or a structure) to a function that requires it for a purpose.
- `Ctrl + r` in vim is for reverse searching in the terminal.
- In Escape mode of vim, `Shift + 8` which is `*` jumps to next occurance of the word under which the cursor is. The cursor can be anywhere in the word.
- `%s/<old_word>/<new_word>/gc` inside vim is used to substitute every `old_word` with `new_word` and vim will ask whether to replace each word or not by jumping to the next word.</br>
# 25/6/23
- Realizing the importance of CAD drawing and its implementation in 3D printing.
- `while(1)` in C will create an infinite loop where 1 denotes "TRUE".
- Killing the program(Ctrl+C) v/s Exiting gracefully using return. By killing the program, you don't erase the values that variables hold, after some time, kernel goes and cleans up memory. This creates a vulnerability(security issue) for a short period of time. When you exit a program gracefully(return 0), the compiler will erase the memory right after exiting.
Assignment :
- Write a program using realloc function.
- Learn about linked lists. What is linked list? What is the most simplest form. Try implementing stack using this.</br>
# 18/6/23
- How is malloc different from calloc? Allocating memory to array of structures using calloc in one go whereas if we use malloc, we need to use a loop.
- How to dereference a double pointer of type structure?
- `cp <file1> <file2>` command copies content of file1(source) to file2 which is the destination.
- What is a packed struct?
- `ulimit -a` is a command used to print details of cpu and memory allocation to all programs which we write.
Assignment : 
- Write a program which uses the realloc() function.
- Write a program on Stack. Use heap memory allocation, do operations on stack like `push,pop,top` with proper testing conditions.</br>

# 4/6/23
- Concept of Variable Shadowing and how does a compiler know which variables to use? The compiler goes from innermost to the outermost(from innermost braces, say,a `for` loop or an `if` statement, then the compiler checks the entire function for the local variables, then it checks for global variables).
- How do you restrict a user from changing a value of a variable. By using 'const', you are making the variable a "read only" object, that is, you can just use the value stored but cannot manipulate it. Suppose you are building an open source API, these constant variables are very important so that other users don't change the value stored in them.
- `struct student *ptr` ,how do you read this? What does it mean? It means `ptr` is a pointer to student type struct. `int *p` means `p` is a pointer to an integer. When you come across pointers and its initialisation and you are not sure what it means, always read from right to left, it will make more sense than reading from left to right. For example, `int const *p` , here `p` is a pointer to a constant of type 'int'. `const int *p` means 'p' is a pointer to an integer which is a constant. Both are same thing. 
- `int const **p` means p is a pointer to a pointer which is a constant of type int. Now, try `const int **p`.

## When you are building a product, ask yourself these questions:-
1) Who are you selling this product to and what are their expectations? If you don't know, you are the one who is supposed to ask them.
2) Does this project make any sense and will it be of any use?
3) Do I have the datasheets of all the components which we are using in this project?
4) How much do I have to invest for building one such product?(it should be as minimal as possible). </br>
5) How much information is fine to be known to customers?
- Scope of a function (public, private).
- Advantages of using a private function. </br>
# 5/3/23
- A brief introduction to Time complexity, Space Complexity and Big-O-Notation.</br>
 Time complexity: Total amount of time take to run an algorithm as a function of length of the input. It represents the number of times a statement is executed. However, time complexity of an algorithm is NOT the actual time required to a execute a particular code, since that depends on other factors like programming language, operating software, disc usage, specialised hardware(Graphic card etc.) . </br>

![](https://adrianmejia.com/images/time-complexity-examples.png)

 Space complexity: Total amount of memory space needed to store the algorithm, run it and complete the task. It included a fixed part and a variable part. Fixed part:- Includes space for the code given, space for variables used, fixed size component variables, space for some other variables if needed etc. Variable part:- Includes the space needed by component variable whose size depends on a particular problem and the space required for other procedures like methods, recursion, object etc.

- Initialising all variables in your code is very important because when you don't, they will posses garbage values and compiler will assume something else.

- A Brief Introduction on how to Debug a program in Ubuntu(Linux) using `gdb`. 
- `gdb` is a very powerful, very vast but not so user friendly tool. 
- command `gdb <binaryfile>` will debug the binary file. 
- There are two modes of execution:- </br>1)Debug mode where additional information required for debugging is added by including `-g` in the command.`gcc -g main.c`.</br> 2) Release mode is just normal execution and the binary file doesn't contain any additional information about debugging.`gcc main.c`.  
- type `ls -lrth` after each mode of execution and see the difference in sizes of two binary files created. 
- Certain commands in gdb:- `run` to run the program, `break` or `b` are used to add a breakpoint, `quit` to exit gdb, `layout` to view program in different layout. For example: `layout src` will display the source code, `layout asm` will display assembly code, `layout regs` to display different registers used. 
- Shortcuts in gdb and their meaning: 'n' for next-> Goes to the next instruction in the program, 'r' for restart-> Runs the program the beginning, 'p' for printing value that a variable has stored-> 'p sum' will print the value of sum.  
- `layout regs` will not display registers used if you are working on a Linux distribution like ubuntu in Windows environment. Only in a perfect linux environment, it works.
- See types of registers used in loops like 'for' and also recursion. Also see assembly code.

# 05/2/23
- The problem with global declaration of variables.
-  ```# include <stdio.h>``` and ```# include "pascals_triangle.h"```. What's the difference? Well ```<>``` are used for system header files. For example:- ```stdio.h```. By using ```<>``` you are telling the compiler to go look for a header file in the current directory you are working in. ```""``` are used for user-defined header files.
